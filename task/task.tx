# Prompt user for input:
# The script then uses a try-except block to handle potential errors during user input.
# It prompts the user to enter the original price and discount percentage using the input function.
# It also checks if the discount percentage is a positive number; otherwise, it raises a ValueError.
# python

# Calculate and print the final price:
# If the input is valid, the script calls the calculate_discount function with the entered values.
# It then prints the final price, formatted with a precision of two decimal places.
# python
# Copy code

This structure ensures that the code is robust, handles user input errors gracefully, and calculates the final price based on the specified discount conditions.
